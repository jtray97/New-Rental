Hi Donna.
Here is the info I would like on the product listing.

For product Category: just search "Toolcard with clip"

Its a similar product to B01N00RERR (ASIN) but its not level gear, so it will probably need a new ASIN

Product Name: "40 in 1 Multitool Card with Removable Money/Belt clip".
Brand Name: "Rayze Products"
Manufacturer: "American Producers"
Price: 19.99
Seller SKU: "Tylers-Card1"
Quantity: 149
Shipping template: I would like it to be similar to the clocks where it is prime to the whole country two days a week, and prime around here always.

The main picture of the profile should be the one named "card 2"

And from what I understand after that I can update any of the other information after the fact. is that correct?

Thanks
--Tyler
